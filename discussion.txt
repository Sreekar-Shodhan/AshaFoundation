project status imp ones are:
stewarding Chapter, state (indian state),

3 chapter , year, state -> funding slashed by those 3 
I give you a state tell me how the funding is in terms of chapter and funding 

on a year basis what happened in different state whole data must be shown 
on a global basis? 

also percentages -> of the total amount spent in a year 

sep column for state , how do you know it is still active(in progress)
project_address has state * 

keep raw data untouched but make new tables with more structure 

create index on project_id and year  index by year  

db save normally in df groupby pid 
sub rows is not possible in sql

why convert to tuple and insert into database? the result is a dict why not insert based on dict?
