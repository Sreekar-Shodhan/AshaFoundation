3 chapter , year, state -> funding slashed by those 3 
I give you a state tell me how the funding is in terms of chapter and funding 

on a year basis what happened in different state whole data must be shown 
on a global basis? 

also percentages -> of the total amount spent in a year 


keep raw data untouched but make new tables with more structure 

create index on project_id and year  index by year  


address text extraxt meta api give co-ordinates gmap api 
how can u analyse all parts using ai 
streamlit ai should create a chart out of data

db, csv  side me
streamlit jaya 
pandas ai for ai generating charts

pid address state 
pid year month chapter curr amount 

1) Analysis of funding by state by year
2) chapter wise analysis of 1) above

- save the data in database , also make it cumulative (currently its not)
- if I get time will work on graphs(visualization) part too
data saved to csv but its raw 
groupby year and get cumulative amount 
maybe combine two df's based on pid 
make it one single csv and make data visualization on that csv 

INR in cumulative 
consolidation based on cur and year -> what is the total in this year and curr 
pid state funding chapter df and csv 
dict for state - check 
check if address -> from the address does it have any of state in dict if yes then what state 
either parse it as parameter or load the data 

pid state 

final df -> pid year chapter amount state curr (ignore other than USD? )
pid year area curr amount(sum) -> this one df 
get state sep and join that state to 46

graph , percenta_state_year imp 
divide percenta_state_year with percentage_population

ex: bihar 2.8 %(amount)
BIHAR,2023,87090.0,3039128.0,2.865624613375942
population per -> 8.6%

2.86/8.6 = 0.3325581395348837

TAMIL NADU,2023,702131.0,3039128.0,23.103041398717
Tamil Nadu pop -> 5.96%

23.10/5.96 =3.885
tamil nadu gets 11.5 times more funding per capita 

for each state whats the per represent taht in graph
